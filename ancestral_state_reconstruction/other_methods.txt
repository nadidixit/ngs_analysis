#In addition to the ape package for ancestral state reconstruction, I also implemented similar models in the 
maximum likelihood framework on the program Mesquite (version 3.70). This is essentailly the same as ape, but some users may find the graphical
user interfacemore friendly. The Mk1 equal transition rates and AsymmMk unequal transition rates models on Mesquite 
are synonymous with the ER and ARD models on ape. Like I mentioned, these models are implemented in teh maximum likelihood framework. 
Mesquite also allows parsimonious reconstructions of ancestral states as well, which can be nice to compare with the likelihood 
reconstructions. You can also perfrom a hierarchical Bayesian ancestral state reconstruction (Bayesian binary MCMC or BBM) on RASP
