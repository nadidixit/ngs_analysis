#This is an example parameter file for denovo (no reference) assembling of R1 reads obtained from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) that used paired-end Illumina sequencing. The file has default 
#comments from the authors of the program, and some added recommendations from me (##Me). In my experience, using R1 reads was sufficient, but that could also be because my sequence data was great. 
#I had around 1-1.5 million reads per sample.

assembly_name                  ## [0] [assembly_name]: Assembly name. Used to name output directories for assembly steps 
                               ##Me   It is possible to have several assemblies (see branching) of the same data with different parameters as you are playing around with your data. It is helpful to name 
                                      the assembly with some information on the parameter(s) that are being played with. Eg. assembly1_clust90_min_samples10
/home/folder/sub_folder/project_directory ## [1] [project_dir]: Project dir (made in curdir if not present) 
                               ## [2] [raw_fastq_path]: Location of raw non-demultiplexed fastq files
                               ##Me My files came demultiplexed from the company that did the sequencing (LGC, Berlin). Demultiplexing can be done as part of the ipyrad assembly process but for this you 
                               need a barcode file (see next)
                               ## [3] [barcodes_path]: Location of barcodes file                                                                                     
/home/folder/sub_folder/project_directory/raw_files/*fastq.gz   ## [4] [sorted_fastq_path]: Location of demultiplexed/sorted fastq files
denovo                         ## [5] [assembly_method]: Assembly method (denovo, reference)
                               ## [6] [reference_sequence]: Location of reference sequence file
gbs                            ## [7] [datatype]: Datatype (see docs): rad, gbs, ddrad, etc.
TGCAG,                         ## [8] [restriction_overhang]: Restriction overhang (cut1,) or (cut1, cut2)
                               ##Me check which restriction enzyme was used to digest your DNA samples
5                              ## [9] [max_low_qual_bases]: Max low quality base calls (Q<20) in a read
                               ##Me default value (5) worked well for me
33                             ## [10] [phred_Qscore_offset]: phred Q score offset (33 is default and very standard)
6                              ## [11] [mindepth_statistical]: Min depth for statistical base calling
                               ##Me default value (6) worked well for me 
6                              ## [12] [mindepth_majrule]: Min depth for majority-rule base calling
                               ##Me default value (6) worked well for me 
10000                          ## [13] [maxdepth]: Max cluster depth within samples
                               ##Me default value (10k) worked well for me
0.85                           ## [14] [clust_threshold]: Clustering threshold for de novo assembly
                               ##Me In my experience, clust_threshold is one of the two most important parameters in sequence assembly. 85% works well for good data, but if you are dealing with a species 
                               complex with extremely closely related species, 90% or 95% works better. It is always best to play around with values between 80% and 95%. Keep in mind, setting this 
                               parameter too low cause can cause non-homologous reads to cluster together, which in turn can also greatly reduce the number of loci in the final assembly. Setting the 
                               parameter too high can result in over-splitting, where potentially good loci are split because of the high sequence similarity threshold. This concept is explained quite 
                               well in Karbstein et al. (2020). 
0                              ## [15] [max_barcode_mismatch]: Max number of allowable mismatches in barcodes
                               ##Me This parameter is irrelevant if you do not have to demultiplex your sequence data
0                              ## [16] [filter_adapters]: Filter for adapters/primers (1 or 2=stricter)
                               ##Me no issues in selecting the stricter value (2)
35                             ## [17] [filter_min_trim_len]: Min length of reads after adapter trim
2                              ## [18] [max_alleles_consens]: Max alleles per site in consensus sequences
                               ##Me I had absolutely no problem with this parameter because I was dealing with diploid species. However, things can be a bit more complicated if you are dealing with 
                               polyploid species. You can for sure choose the ploidy level here, but you should know that heterozygous sites are called by assuming diploidy in all cases. Meaning, a 
                               variant is considered an allele only when present in 50% of the reads
0.05                           ## [19] [max_Ns_consens]: Max N's (uncalled bases) in consensus
                               ##Me default worked well for me (5%)
0.05                           ## [20] [max_Hs_consens]: Max Hs (heterozygotes) in consensus
                               ##Me default worked well for me
23                             ## [21] [min_samples_locus]: Min # samples per locus for output
                               ##Me This is the second of the two most important parameters. This parameter heavily influences % of missing sites in your assembly, so if you are dealing with analyses 
                               that are especially sensitive to missing sites (like PCA), I would recommend to pay special attention while choosing this value. Setting the value too low would retain loci 
                               that don't have representation from many samples, which in turn increases the overall missing sites, but in general, more information is retained as more loci are retained. 
                               This has the added effect of increasing bootstrap value in phylogenetic tree calculations. Setting the value too high would throw away too many loci which do not have 
                               enough sample representation. But in this case, the number of missing sites goes down, however, with more information potentially lost in the form of loci that were thrown 
                               out. This is observed to decrease bootstrap values in phylogenetic trees. Karbstein et al. (2020) recommend setting this value to 10% of the total samples you have, which 
                               has always worked well for me (For example, I had 234 samples in this analysis, so I chose 23)
0.2                            ## [22] [max_SNPs_locus]: Max # SNPs per locus
                               ##Me default worked for me (20%)
8                              ## [23] [max_Indels_locus]: Max # of indels per locus
                               ##Me default (8) worked well for me
0.5                            ## [24] [max_shared_Hs_locus]: Max # heterozygous sites per locus
                               ##Me while 50% has worked well for me, this value perhaps depends on the species being studied as very high shared heterozygous sites could simply be becasue of paralogs 
                               clustering together. Playing with this parameter is a good idea. 
5, 0, 0, 0                     ## [25] [trim_reads]: Trim raw read edges (R1>, <R1, R2>, <R2) (see docs)
                               ##Me based on the fastqc files for my samples, I saw it fit to trim the first 5 bp off my sequences. It is probably best to first check the fastqc files of your samples 
                               before you choose a value (or not) here. Even if you choose to not trim, bad quality bp are likely to be gotten rid of through the max_low_qual_bases and 
                               phred_Qscore_offset parameters. 
0, 0, 0, 0                     ## [26] [trim_loci]: Trim locus edges (see docs) (R1>, <R1, R2>, <R2)
                               ##Me I chose not to trim loci edges to avoid too much trimming of the sequences.
*                              ## [27] [output_formats]: Output formats (see docs)
                               ## [28] [pop_assign_file]: Path to population assignment file
                               ## [29] [reference_as_filter]: Reads mapped to this reference are removed in step 3
